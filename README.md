# Descartes_public

There are 2 attempts the first test.py is a very simple go at predicting the flag and amount and the descartes_auto_insurance.py is more organised. They both seem to work reducing the loss function but I haven't quite got the output right so the accuracy is very low.

Packages are: matplotlib 3.3.3 numpy 1.19.3 pandas 1.2.0 torch 1.7.1

hope it runs ok
